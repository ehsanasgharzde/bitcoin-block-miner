# Bitcoin Block Miner

This is a simple Bitcoin block miner implemented in Python. The project consists of three main files:

## Files

1. **main.py**: The main script that creates instances of the Blockchain and Miner classes, mines a new block, and displays blockchain information.

2. **miner.py**: Defines the Miner class responsible for mining new blocks and interacting with the blockchain.

3. **blockchain.py**: Defines the Blockchain class, which represents the blockchain structure and its functions.

## Getting Started

To run the Bitcoin block miner, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

## Code Structure

- **Blockchain Class**: Represents the blockchain structure with methods for creating blocks, validating the chain, and more.

- **Miner Class**: Handles mining new blocks, displaying blockchain information, and documenting the code.

## Usage

- When you run `main.py`, it creates a blockchain, a miner, and performs the following actions:
  - Documents the functions and libraries used in both classes.
  - Mines a new block and displays information about the mined block.
  - Displays the current state of the blockchain.

## Important Notes

- This is a simplified example for educational purposes and does not include the full complexity of a real Bitcoin miner.

- It's essential to understand that this code is a starting point and lacks many critical features, such as transaction processing and robust consensus algorithms.
